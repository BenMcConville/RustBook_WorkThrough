-Chapter 04  OwnerShip

-Rust does not use a guarbage collector by utilizing owenerships.
-All primative data types are stored on the stack as their size is known
- String literals are immutable as they are stored on the stack and are of a fixed size.
-Rust has a string type which is stored on the heap which is muttable (does not need to be mut though)
-To create a deep copy in rust use var.clone();
-When modifying a reference it must be a mut reference and their can only be one at a time.
-Multiple immutable references are ok but when a mut referece exists only one reference can exist.
