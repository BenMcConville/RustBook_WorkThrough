fn main()	{
	println!("Hello, World!");
}
//fn defines functions 
//main function defines first thing that is executed in every executable
//The function println! is a macro (how meta programming is done in rust)
//When calling a function we remove the !
//After calling rustc <filename.rs> a binary executable is created.
