Common Collections

Rust includes in its standard libary data structures called collections which are stored on the heap meaning they can change size during runtime. Vector, string, hash map.

When storing multiple types in a vec we can use enums

-Strings are stored as a collection of bytes + some methods
-Strings are wrappers over Vec<u8>

HashMaps

Hash maps store HashMap<K, V>, a key of type K and a value of type V which does this via a Hashing Function.
