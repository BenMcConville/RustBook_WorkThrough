Generic Types, Traits, & Lifetimes


Generic Types:

-Generics can be defined in the functions signature

-Genrics do not impact runtime/performance

# When rust compiles code with generics it uses monomorphisation which undose what we do and assigns types to the generics.



Traits:

-You can only impelement traits if one of the traits or types is local.
