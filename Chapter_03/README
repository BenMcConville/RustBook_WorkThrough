- Common Programming Concepts
- In this section we will learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.

- Variables are immutable by default but can be changed by adding a mut tag

- Constants must have a type annotated (must be set pre-runtime) (constant names all uppercase)

-Shadowing lets you change variable type (shadows cannot be mutable)

-Integers can be of type signed or unsigned (i-size and u-size depends on computer i.e 64 bit or 32 big etc)
-Rust defaults to i32


- Compound Types
- To extract values from a tuple we use pattern matching
- Arrays are stored on the stack 


- Functions (Rust is an expression based language i.e(everything results in a value (macros as the exeption)))
- Rust doesn't care where functions are defined.

-Statements vs Expressions
-When returning branch expressions both types must be the same. (Rust must know at compile time the type of variables) 

-Loops
-3 Types of loops: loop, while, for
